"My Foo Is Strong" was born from a multitude of concepts pulled from the past of it's creator.  A play on words of "Your Kung Fu is Strong," the title juxtaposes Foo for Fu.  Foo, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable">metasyntactic variable</a>, is used to identify any number of topics.  A placeholder name for something under discussion.  As the articles published on this blog are not specific to one particular subject, the usage of the metasyntactic variable <em>foo</em> seemed to fit quite nicely.
